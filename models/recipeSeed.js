      instructions: "Soak the corn husks in a bowl of hot water, using a plate to keep them submerged, until pliable, 1 hour.\nMeanwhile, make the filling: Bring the bouillon powder and 4 cups water to a simmer in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the chicken and simmer until cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the chicken and let cool; cut into small pieces. Reserve the broth.\nPuree the cilantro and 1 1/4 cups of the reserved broth in a food processor until smooth (save the remaining broth for another use). Transfer to a medium pot. Add the garlic, cumin and salsa and bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook until slightly reduced, about 12 minutes. Stir in the chicken and season with salt. Remove from the heat and let cool.\nMake the dough: Soak the ancho chile in hot water until soft, about 15 minutes. Drain the chile, then mince to make a paste. Combine the chile paste, masa harina, lard, 2 2/3 cups warm water and 2 teaspoons salt\nin a bowl. Mix with your hands (or use a mixer with the paddle attachment) 10 to 15 minutes, or until a marble-size ball of dough floats in water.\nDrain the husks and pat dry. Starting 1/2 inch from the wide end, spread about 3 tablespoons of the dough down a husk, leaving a 1-inch border on the sides. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the chicken filling down the center of the dough, then fold in the sides of the husk, wrapping the dough around the filling. Fold up the narrow end of the husk. Repeat with the remaining husks, dough and filling.\nSet a steamer basket in a large pot filled with 1 to 2 inches of water. Arrange the tamales standing up in the steamer, folded-side down. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then cover and steam until the tamales pull away from the husks, about 1 hour. Remove from the steamer and let cool slightly before unwrapping."

Roll 1/2 pie dough to approximately 1/8-inch thick and about 1 inch larger than the pie plate. Fit in into the pie pan leaving the overlap intact. Fill with fruit filling and dot top with 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter. Brush beaten egg with pastry brush around the rim of the pie. Roll out the remaining dough and make a lattice top.

    category: "American",
    ingredients: [
        "1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (plus more for rolling the dough)",
        "2 teaspoons granulated sugar",
        "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
        "6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces",
        "3/4 cup granulated sugar",
        "1/3 cup all-purpose flour",
        "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt",

        "2 teaspoons vanilla extract",
        "4 bananas, peeled",

        "3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar",
        "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
      ],
      instructions: "For the dough, in a large bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, and salt. Sprinkle in the butter pieces and cut them into the flour with a pastry cutter (or 2 knives or your fingertips) until the mixture is crumbly and the pieces are the size of small peas. Mix in 5 tablespoons very cold water and toss with a fork until the dough just comes together.\nPlace the dough on the floured counter and knead a few times, just to make a ball. Don't overwork the dough or the crust will be tough! Lightly flour the counter. Flatten the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic. Let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes. (If making more than 1 hour ahead, let it rest on the counter for 10 minutes before rolling out.)\nRoll the dough out on a floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Fit into a 9-inch pie plate and trim to a 1/2-inch overhang all around. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with a fork or your fingers. Chill the pie shell in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cover the shell with a piece of parchment paper and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake on the bottom rack until the crust is set but still blond in color, about 20 minutes. Remove the paper and beans or weights and bake until the crust is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes more. Let cool completely on a rack.\nFor the custard, in a saucepan, combine the granulated sugar, flour, and salt. Add the milk gradually while stirring. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it begins to bubble. Cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, or until it forms firm peaks.\nStir a small amount of the hot milk mixture into the beaten egg yolks in a small bowl. This will temper the yolks so they don't turn into scrambled eggs. Stir the tempered yolks back into the rest of the custard. Cook for 2 more minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla. Slice 2 bananas into the cooled pastry crust. Top with half of the custard and slice the remaining bananas on top. Top with the rest of the custard. Chill for at least 1 hour.\nFor the whipped cream, in a cold bowl with an electric mixer, beat the cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla until firm peaks form. Be careful not to overbeat or your cream will turn to butter. Watch as you beat and stop when it gets thick and stays on the beaters when you remove them from the bowl.\nTop the pie with the whipped cream and serve."

Place about 1 tablespoon (about ½ ounce) meat filling in center of each dough circle, and pleat dough edge, gathering top like a pouch to enclose filling. When you have pleated all the way around, pinch top edges together firmly, and give the dough a little twist to make a stem and to make sure the khinkali is well sealed.

Place finished dumplings on a piece of lightly floured parchment paper; cover loosely with plastic wrap, and repeat process with remaining dough portions and filling. Bring a large pot of salted water and bay leaves to a boil over high. Carefully add half of dumplings to water, and stir gently with a wooden spoon (without piercing dumplings) to make sure they don’t stick to bottom of pot. Boil until dough is tender and meat is cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove khinkali with a spider, and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining half of dumplings.
